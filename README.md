## How to Play
- Install Ruby & the bundler gem if you haven't already ([Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/), [bundler](http://bundler.io/))

- Once downloaded, run these terminal commands in the game folder:
  - `bundle install`
  - `ruby game.rb`


- Use arrow keys to move the cursor, and 'space' or 'enter' to select and place pieces

## Features
* Modular design: each piece inherits from super classes that contain broader functions, which keeps the code DRY
* Displays potential moves when a piece is selected
* colorize gem allows use of arrow keys for navigation
